These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.   Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).   Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).   These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:    '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.  tBodyAcc-XYZ  tGravityAcc-XYZ  tBodyAccJerk-XYZ  tBodyGyro-XYZ  tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  tBodyAccMag  tGravityAccMag  tBodyAccJerkMag  tBodyGyroMag  tBodyGyroJerkMag  fBodyAcc-XYZ  fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  fBodyGyro-XYZ  fBodyAccMag  fBodyAccJerkMag  fBodyGyroMag  fBodyGyroJerkMag  The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:       mean(): Mean value      std(): Standard deviation	  == MODIFICATION TO NAMES -- leading 't' is changed to "time"	  -- leading 'f' is changed to "FFT"-- special characters removed 	  ==========================================================VARIABLES:timeBodyAccmeanX     		Numeric -
